        "\n",
        "The assignment of consistent, reproducible, high-quality partial atomic charges for biomolecular systems is frustrated by the reliance of popular methods (such as AM1-BCC and RESP) on quantum chemical methods, which suffer from multiple challenges: (1) they require a reproducible way to generate molecular conformations in order to ensure reproducible charges; (2) large molecules such as biopolymers require fragmentation and capping in a manner that does not perturb their electronic structure; and (3) the expense of even semiempirical quantum chemical computations can become prohibitive for large biopolymers or small molecule datasets. Here, we present an fast alternative approach to rapidly deriving partial atomic charges (which could function as the initial stage for a bond charge correction scheme) that uses only the molecular topology, thereby avoiding the need to reproducibly generate molecular conformations. Instead of sloq quantum chemical calculations, a fast graph convolutional neural network is used to estimate parameters for a simple graph-based charge computation scheme that respects resonance structures and preserves total molecular charge. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment of partial atomic charges for biomolecular simulations has traditionally utilized one of two methods:\n",
        "1. An _electrostatic potential fitting_ approach such as [RESP](http://doi.org/10.1021/j100142a004) that enumerates one or more molecular conformations, computes the electrostatic potential on multiple shells around the molecule, and performs a restraint fit to the electrostatic potential\n",
        "2. A _bond charge correction_ scheme such as [AM1-BCC](goo.gl/2HPt1e) [(see also)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.10128) that enumerates one or more molecular conformations, performs a semi-empirical quantum chemical calculation followed by population analysis to obtain inexpensive but crude partial charge estimates, and then corrects them with a set of rules that alter charges across bonds\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods suffer from several drawbacks:\n",
        "* They require enumeration of molecular conformations. In order to reproducibly assign charges, these conformations must also be reproducibly computed, which presents a highly challenging problem to ensure across molecular cheminformatics toolkits.\n",
        "* They utilize quantum chemical calculations, which are inherently slow, even for semiempirical calculations.\n",
        "* Large biopolymers, such as proteins and nucleic acids, are too slow to perform direct quantum chemical computations, requiring either fragmentation and capping in a manner that preserves electronic properties or the use of linear-scaling (such as divide-and-conquer) quantum chemical approaches. Neither problem is trivial to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we consider whether the molecular topology---that is, the molecular graph containing information about the identity and chemical connecivity of atoms in a small molecule or biopolymer---could be used in a rapid scheme that estimate partial charges, thereby avoiding the need for enumeration of geometries, quantum chemical calculations, or fragmentation or linear-scaling schemes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The main idea\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternative methods that utilize only the molecular topology (or molecular graph) exist. In particular, the [VCharge](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ci034148o) scheme of Gilson and coworkers presents a particularly clever scheme, which we briefly overview here. A related scheme, [charge equilibration](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/j100161a070) by Rappé and Goddard, presents physical reasoning that inspires this model and is also worth reading, though the charge equilibration approach requires a molecular conformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is to determine, for each atom $i$, two strictly positive parameters, $e_i$ and $s_i$, that govern the flow of partial charge among atoms in a manner that preserves the total charge on the system:\n",
        "* $e_i$ is a parameter related to the _electronegativity_ of the atom, governing how much it attracts charge\n",
        "* $s_i$ is a parameter related to the _hardness_ of the atom, or how much it resists accumulating or donating charge\n",
        "\n",
        "These two parameters are determined by a process described in more detail below.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Determining partial charges from the electronegativity and hardness parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "Once determined, an optimization problem is solved to identify the partial atomic charges, $q_i$, on each atom $i$. We minimize\n",
        "\n",
        "$$U({\\bf q}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[ e_i q_i +  \\frac{1}{2}  s_i q_i^2 \\right]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "subject to the constraint that the total charge, $Q$, is preserved:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\sum_{i=1}^N q_i = Q$$\n",
        "\n",
        "It is straigtforward to solve this using [the method of Lagrange multipliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier). \n",
        "We first introduce the constraint equation into the optimization equation with the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
        "U({\\bf q}) &=& \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[ e_i q_i +  \\frac{1}{2}  s_i q_i^2\\right] - \\lambda \\, \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^N q_j - Q \\right) \\\\\n",
        "&=& \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[ (e_i - \\lambda) q_i +  \\frac{1}{2}  s_i q_i^2 \\right] + Q\n",
        "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
        "We find the minimum by computing the partial derivatives $\\partial U / \\partial q_i$ and equating them to zero at the solution $q_i^*$:\n",
        "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
        "0 = (e_i - \\lambda) + s_i q_i^* \\\\\n",
        "q_i^* = - \\frac{(e_i - \\lambda)}{s_i}\n",
        "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
        "\n",
        "We can now solve for $\\lambda$ using the constraint equation:\n",
        "\n",

        "\\sum_{i=1}^N q^*_i = Q \\\\\n",
        "\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{-e_i + \\lambda}{s_i} = Q \\\\\n",
        "- \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{e_i}{s_i} + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{1}{s_i} = Q \\\\\n",
        "\\lambda = \\frac{Q + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N e_i \\, s_i^{-1}}{\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N s_j^{-1}}\n",
        "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
        "\n",
        "This yields the solution\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
        "q_i^* &=& - e_i s_i^{-1} + \\lambda s_i^{-1} \\\\\n",

        "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
        "\n",
        "It is readily apparent that, once the $e_i$ and $s_i$ parameters are determined, the partial charges $q_i^*$ for even very large molecules can be rapidly computed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Determining the electronegativity and hardness parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "To determine the the electronegativity $e_i$ and harness $h_i$ parameters, the original VCharge scheme used the following equation\n",
        "\n",
        "$$e_i = e_i^0 + \\sum_{j \\in N(i)} w(\\epsilon_{ij}) \\, f(e^o_i - e^o_j) \\sum_{j \\in N(i)} \\sum_{k \\in N(j)} w(\\epsilon_{ij}, \\epsilon_{kl}) \\, f(e^o_i - e^o_k)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $N(i)$ denotes the set of neighbors bonded to atom $j$, $\\epsilon_{ij}$ is a discrete category (or bond type) for the edge connecting atoms $i$ and $j$, $w(\\epsilon)$ is a weight that depends on this bond category, and $f(x)$ is a nonlinear function.\n",
        "\n",
        "This scheme has a striking resemblance to a graph convolutional neural network, with two hidden layers that aggregate information from parameters of atoms bonded to each atom (and atoms bonded to \\emph{those} atoms) via weights and nonlinearities.\n",
        "Given the advances in graph convolutional and message-passing neural networks since 2003, the question immediately arises: What if we simply use a modern graph convolutional or message-passing network to determine the $e_i$ and $s_i$?\n",
        "\n",
        "We explore this question here.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If we avoid using features that are altered in different resonance forms, we will not need to average charges over resonance forms of the same molecule, which would be highly advantageous when dealing with very large molecules.\n",
        "\n",
